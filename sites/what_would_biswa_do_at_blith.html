      title: "What would Biswa do at Blith?",
      created_at: "January 26, 2026",
      content: `So before we do this, here's a little insight in what's my current process to write these things.
What I do is I write the content in a .md file, then I copy paste all the content into an html file manually and push everything to Github. Then I change the index page so that it incorporates the new file.
This is tedious, and I didn't mind doing this for the first 2 of them, but going forward, I want to automate the whole process. I promise that the next one will be what I did to automate the whole process.

But then what's this one about?
Well, in my infinite wisdom, I was walking in the road going to the Research Park and thought, I should buy the Biswa tickets, and I started day dreaming what that Stand-up whould be like.

And I came up with one. I'll write it as I'm thinking, and stop when I don't have any idea going forward. If I have to guess, there won't be a closure, there will be just a line and then it'll end there itself. I probably won't end in a cliffhanger, or will it? (I can assure you that the jokes below will be better that this one)


"
So mai baitha tha ek din on my couch as I frequently do, and my manager called me and he told me ki (whipering)"Sir, ek gig aaya hai"
Mai bola "Range kharab hai ya tu dhire se bol raha hai?"
He said "Sir, this is serious, IIT Gandhinagar ka gig aaya hai"
Now, I have done tours to US, Australia, Europe and all that, ,wo gaye sab bhaad me.
I have so much, so much material that I can write on IIT, kya batau. If the entire stand-up audince was just IITians, I'd be India's only comic. But ig sablog utne smart nahi hote.

So I was so happy when my manager said ki sir, you have a gig at IIT Gandhinagar. And then he told me what are the ticket prices and expected participation. (Exhales).
I'm not kidding, maine lockdown mai recorded shows isse jyaada price me beche hai.

Bhai itne paise me to mai mere driver se skit likhwa ke padh lu yaha pe and it'll still be underpriced.

And that's exactly what I've done. Thanks Shankar.

Bhai mere last tour ka hotel budget isse jyaada tha, and that was for 2 days.


But then I realized ki "Biswa, remember that time jab tu bhi Garib tha. Jab tu bhi ice cream leke uske upar ka paper chat ta tha."

I can see ki around 60% of you laughed and 40% were like ye kya pagal baat kr raha hai.

But as I said, abhi to boht paise hai. But ab saala ek ice cream khaaya to dusre din doctor ka appointment lena padta hai. sugar high, BP high, jukaam ho gaya, wajan badh gaya, rabies, aids sab kuchh. Kyo?? Saala ek ice cream kha liya.

So I came up with a theory, which'll be very helpful for you guys, ki apna to time gaya, life waste, next generation to sahi se jeele.

And this is mostly applicable to the 40% of you in the crowd.

Take a huge loan right now, jab jawani hai, full maje karo.
Ghoom lo jitna ghoomna hai. Goa, US, Bangcock, Russia, jaha jaana hai, jab tak jawani hai ghoom lo. Jaise jawani settle ho jaayegi, and I'm telling you ki ho jaayegi, start repaying the debt. Tab to tumhe achha lagega. "Are aaj to 10 ghante ek hi jagah pe baithenge, pure pair ka orgasm nikal jaega"
"
The end. See you on the next one.
