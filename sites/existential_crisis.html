Yep, I'm having one. Don't even know if I spelled that one right.

Also what a beautiful app Paper is, and how shame it is that it doesn't have a vim mode. Can I style neovim like this? Let's ask our best friend(sarcasm) ChatGPT.

So I've got it not that close to Paper, but close enough, and more importantly minimal enough. Minimal is going to be my entire thing. From today to ig let's say end of February. It's going to be FFF, Fuck Fucking-distractions February. Sorry for the bad joke. But you know what, I don't care, I don't give a shit. I'm hot bitch.


But what's this all about? Why minimal, and how minimal. For starters, let's just eliminate few things right off the bat. YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Apple TV, Apple Music.

Music?? Yep, FFF.

This is obviously inspired friend of the blog Chris Nolan. Chris lives a minimalist lifestyle, and he's the greatest director imo, so it clearly works. Now the scientific part of me is like you're leaving things on the table. Music enhances your life. I've experienced first hand that when the thing that I'm studying is not captivating enough, music can just provide that dopamine to monkey part of the brain so your working brain can function on task in hand. But here's my answer to that, do difficult-esque things. Most of the times when what I do is not captivating is when it's either too easy to too hard. So when I'm doing Machine Learning the next, which I mean the textbook part is not captivating cause it's too easy to mug and too hard to derive, I'm gonna change the derivations, I'm gonna hunt em down, gonna catch em all, Pokemon.

So that's that. And beyond the deleting and all that part, it's about the mindset, about the present. I've prepared timetables. Timetables are good when you don't generally what to do a certain period of time and you're arranging your tasks to extract your optimum performance. Also they are too on the paper. But my problem is that I'm just way too inaccurate to figure out on my own. I've made the timetable, I've even developed my own timetable software with my favorite Vim keybindings, but I still don't open it unless I want to develop something on the software itself. So what to do? One thing that I'll do this week is that I'll note down everytime I didn't do something that was written on the calendar and I didn't do, and I'm gonna write why. Also I'm gonna write it when I do something that I've written on a calendar.

Tangent alert!
I was thinking how success gives you happiness and failure gives you sadness, but I think the part that should be studied is that success gives you confidence while failure gives you confusion. With happiness and sadness, you clearly know what you want, but with confidence and confusion, it's a balancing act. I'm not sure where to go with this, but maybe I'll write about this sometime later.

So what now? I'm gonna sleep while reading a book, wake up tomorrow, go to the gym, no earphones, and we'll see where do we go next.

Btw I know this one's very late and I had promised that I'll write about how I automated the website, but frankly, I've done that almost couple of weeks ago so I don't remember all the tiny details that I would have liked to go into, so that blog won't come possibly ever. Cheers!


Yep, It's not over. Just because I want to be minimalist doesn't mean I want to be  laid back. In fact the opposite, I want to be obsessed about what really means a lot to me. I want to do be obsessed, I really do. Now it's over. Publishing now.
